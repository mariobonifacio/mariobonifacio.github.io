This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(scales)
library(ggalt)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
vbm_demo <- read_csv("vbm_adopt.csv")
```

```{r}
vbm_demo %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  filter(age_group != "35-64") %>% 
  summarize(young_adopt = min(share),
            sr_adopt = max(share),
            gap = sr_adopt - young_adopt) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = reorder(type, gap), x = young_adopt, xend = sr_adopt)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  geom_dumbbell(size = 3,
                colour_x = "darkseagreen",
                colour_xend = "darkgoldenrod1",
                color = "darkgray") +
  geom_label(size=4, vjust = 0.5,
                  aes(young_adopt, label = young_adopt), color = "springgreen4") +
        geom_label(aes(sr_adopt, label = sr_adopt), 
                  color="darkgoldenrod", size=4, vjust= 0.5) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Seniors vote absentee 10% more than young voters in all scenarios", subtitle =  "Difference between voters 34 or under who voted absentee vs. those 65 or older")

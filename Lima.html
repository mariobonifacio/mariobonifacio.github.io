Hey what’s up man, I can go on and on forever with things I love to eat in Lima, the traditional breakfast of pork chícharron and sweet potato, the freshness of all seafood, tiraditos, octupus in an olive sauce, and the new ways to make ceviche mixed with passion fruit, mango, and even served “hot” in a bowl with small beach rocks inside. 
There are the hot sandwiches at “La Lucha” restaurant, served with 5 different types of French fries, the chicken sandwich which is unlike any other chicken sandwich in the world.
Things to see, I love the boardwalk “Malecón”, for miles, you are in a promenade 100 meters above the shore so you always have a panoramic view of the ocean as you are walking.  I love the film club “filmoteca”, a neoclassic building in the historic downtown center which is always showing great movies for 50 cents, and the streets of the Barranco neighborhood with old colonial homes, dramatic  murals and bohemian vibe, the Mali museum..
Again, I could go on and on forever, why do you ask?

# EAT
The traditional breakfast is pork chicharron (cracklings) and sweet potato
Fresh seafood, tiraditos (a byproduct of Japanese immigrant influence), octopus in olive sauce, ceviche (which can be served mixed w/passion fruit, w/mango, or "hot" alongside beach rocks).
Hot sandwiches & tortas at La Lucha restaurant, including the unassuming but renowned chicken sandwich, w/5 kinds of French fries

# SEE
The boardwalk Malecon, which is a promenade 100 meters above so you always have a panoramic view of the ocean
The film club Filmoteca in one of the neoclassical buildings in historic downtown, which always has great movies for something like 50 cents
The Barranco neighborhood has old colonial homes, dramatic murals, and -- recently -- a Bohemian vibe
MALi is all right… the really cool art -- the colonial era stuff and sculptures still heavy with pre-Colombian influences – is all in Cusco
Miraflores is the historically rich neighborhood so it’s pleasant and easy, but not too exciting or surprising – sorta like a Starbucks…
